	Middle_probability           float64     `json:",omitempty"` // optional # Probability of this relay to be selected for the middle position.

Contains only additional addresses of a relay that are found unreachable and only as long as a minority of directory authorities performs reachability tests on these additional addresses. Relays with an unreachable primary address are not included in the network status consensus and excluded entirely. Likewise, relays with unreachable additional addresses tested by a majority of directory authorities are not included in the network status consensus and excluded here, too. If at any point network status votes will be added to the processing, relays with unreachable addresses will be included here. Addresses are in arbitrary order. IPv6 hex characters are all lower-case. Omitted if empty.
